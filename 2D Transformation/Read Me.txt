Program to implement linear transformations - scaling, rotation and transformation
on polygons and discs(and ellipses) using matrix multiplication.

Input format:
Type polygon or disc
In case of polygon type x coordinates with spaces
		   type y coordinates with spaces
In case of disc
type x-coordinate of centre, y-coordinate of centre, radius (all separated with spaces)

For rotation
R (angle in degrees)
For transformation
T (trans in x direction) (trans in y direction)
For scaling
S (scaling along x direction) (scaling accross y direction)

e.g
disc
0 0 2
T 1 2
S 1 2
R 45
